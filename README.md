# Escape_Vietnam
Our team set out to create an educational experience for everyone stuck at home, as COVID-19 has disrupted many of the traditional learning opportunities. When we look around for inspiration, we saw our family history. Our familiesâ€™ stories are some of the many Vietnamese refugee stories after the Vietnam war. We want to honor our families and other refugees through this simulation.
